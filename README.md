Purpose:
This Python code implements a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game, where the user plays against a computer-generated opponent.

How to Use:
Run the code: Execute the Python script.
Input your choice: When prompted, enter either "s" for Snake, "w" for Water, or "g" for Gun.
View the result: The code will display the choices made by both the user and the computer, as well as the outcome of the game (win, lose, or draw).
Code Explanation:
Import: The random module is imported to generate random choices for the computer.
Variable definitions:
computer: Stores the computer's random choice (1 for Snake, -1 for Water, 0 for Gun).
youstr: Stores the user's input as a string.
youdict: Maps the input characters ("s", "w", "g") to their corresponding numerical values.
reversedict: Maps the numerical values to their corresponding string representations.
User input: The user is prompted to enter their choice, which is stored in youstr.
Choice conversion: The user's choice is converted from a string to a numerical value using youdict.
Game logic:
The code compares the user's choice (you) to the computer's choice (computer).
If the choices are equal, it's a draw.
Otherwise, the code determines the winner based on the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors rules.
Output: The code prints the choices made by both the user and the computer, along with the outcome of the game.
Additional Notes:
This code provides a basic implementation of Rock-Paper-Scissors. You can enhance it by adding features like multiple rounds, scorekeeping, or a user-friendly interface.
Consider error handling to handle invalid user inputs.
For more complex game logic or advanced features, explore Python's standard library or third-party modules.
